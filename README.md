# **Cicada 3301 Chronology**

This is my chronological organisation of the cicada 3301 case.
As a picture editor in the Director's Guild of Canada, 
I may not offer a lot in the world of cryptography, 
but I believe I offer a lot in terms of 
storytelling, editing, and the overall image aka "the big picture". 

I'm a filmmaker first, musician second, and graphic designer third. 
I am only a hobbyist puzzle solver somewhere in there. 
If I have seen anything it has been from standing on the shoulders of these giants: 
The Uncovering Cicada Wiki, Cicada Solvers, Scream314, 3301, and the entire cicada community, thank you.

Amen the void.
