CINEMA SINS by Kyle Popovich: 

- film was released digitally by Lionsgate Films on March 12, 2021.
- I'm Canadian, and Lionsgate is a Canadian distributor, so I'm ashamed and apologize.
- actor turned director never showed history of cryptography in filming 
- they changed every single image, making newcombers believe, and believers confused. 
- they changed every single image, going against 3301's mandate:
"DO NOT EDIT OR CHANGE THIS BOOK ⁘ OR THE MESSAGE CONTAINED WITHIN ⁘ EITHER THE WORDS OR THEIR NUMBERS ⁘ FOR ALL IS SACRED"
