==================================================
===== THE TIMELINE: ==============================

2012-01-04	January 4th	"Hello [...] Intelligent individuals [...] Good luck [...]"

3301 allegedly posts [final.jpg] on 4chan (unverified/link missing?, but was/is known as the most popular anonymous place)
[final.jpg] is named [1CcV1.jpg] but still works in OutGuess (does OutGuess stay on jpeg web conversions?)
[final.jpg] first gives a clue, opening in a text editor = TIBERIVS CLAVDIVS CAESAR says "lxxt>33m2mqkyv2gsq3q=w]O2ntk"
[final.jpg] first uses a Caesar Cipher: 4 shift = imgur.com/m9sYK.jpg (Decoy Photo/Clue)
[final.jpg] first uses OutGuess: Book code + reddit.com/r/a2e7j6ic78h0j 
3301 first uses an anagram for the reddit username CageThrottleUs = CharoletteGuest
3301 (as u/CageThrottleUs) posts "Welcome" [KXLOP.jpg] giving = PGP Key ID 7A35090F via OutGuess 


2012-01-07	January 7th	

3301 uses an anagram again for the reddit username ImagoOnNib = Mabinogion 
3301 (as u/ImagoOnNib/Mabinogion grows impatient "Problems?" 
3301 first uses a Vigenère cipher, hiding the key in the reddit header (Maya Numerals) and description (Substution cipher) 
3301 [final.jpg] first uses a Book Code: Mabinogion + Book code = Call us at us tele phone numBer two one four three nine oh nine six oh eight
[final.jpg] first uses a landline phone number: (+1)2143909608 = 3301 x 506 x 503 [final.jpg] dimensions = 845145127.com
[final.jpg] first uses a domain: 845145127.com = [cicada.jpg] 
[cicada.jpg] uses OutGuess again to say: 

	KYLE'S NOTES:
	Seeing as it's been three days since the first post, 
	and all these steps are linked, 
	I assume 3301 is just sitting by the telephone waiting for someone to figure it out. 
	This would explain the push to make their Mabinogion username, and the OutGuess saying "Key" for "Problems?".
	This shows the reddit header, decription as the Vigenère cipher and posts as the books for the book code, 
	was much harder and complicated than the simple phone call "3301 is one number, find the other two from the final.jpg" 
	Not 3 days, but the same day solvers were able to figure it out, land on the website, OutGuess the Cicada.jpg and 
	would end up making 3301 have to hurry up! (or was this planned all along?)
	This shows that 3301 isn't great with pacing and incrementaion of risk and reward. 
	This shows that 3301 want the solver to finish, giving multiple clues. 
	I don't know who the "We" is that is looking for highly intelligent individuals. 
	I don't beleive there is a prize, "a test" means you are being graded. 
	"the road to finding us." again hints at multiple people. 
	"We look forward to meeting the few that will make it all the way through." is very welcoming. 
	"Good luck. 3301" is very challenging, motivational, mysterious, and hinting at a prime truth (1 and self). 
	

2012-01-09	January 9th 

845145127.com updates to real-world co-ordinates (unverified photos, as they have OutGuess with PGP on them?)
[cicada.jpg] 


2012-01-11	January 11th 

845145127.com first uses binary, updating the page to only to tabs and spaces:

845145127.com changes to 127.0.0.1 and the previous IP (75.119.203.244) stopped responding to pings and TCP SYNs.






2013		January 	"Hello again. Our serach for intelligent individuals now continues."

366 days since the 2012 Cicada puzzle began. Nothing had happened in 11 months.

Until the 5th of January 2013, when a second image was posted to /x/ and /b/ imageboards on 4chan. 
There were three threads where 3301 posted 232.jpg on 4chan, two times on /b/ 23 hours apart(1,2) and once on /x/.


Key points about the track is the initial "breath" sound, believed to be the sound of many cicadas and the tempo changes, beginning at approximately 135 bpm, accelerating to 145bpm, then slowing to 125bpm. This has led some to believe that the song has been slowed down by 5%. The only instruments used were a guitar acoustic and electric and an effect driven bass drum.
The song is 2:47 long, or 167 seconds, which is prime. It is also a reversal of the name of the file: 761.mp3, and 761 is also prime.
A draft spectral anlysis (http://www.anony.ws/i/2013/01/07/SE5OU.png) shows a constant hum at 15.4-16.1kHz, and empty notches under 500Hz starting from 1:56. A hexdump of the mp3 file revealed the following message:

			KYLE'S NOTE: 
			Try extending the song to 761 seconds! (3301 loves reversing and flipping numbers)
