==================================================
===== THE TIMELINE: ==============================

2012-01-04	January 4th	"Hello [...] Intelligent individuals [...] Good luck [...]"

3301 allegedly posts [final.jpg] on 4chan (unverified/link missing?, but was/is known as the most popular anonymous place)
[final.jpg] is named [1CcV1.jpg] but still works in OutGuess (does OutGuess stay on jpeg web conversions?)
[final.jpg] first gives a clue, opening in a text editor = TIBERIVS CLAVDIVS CAESAR says "lxxt>33m2mqkyv2gsq3q=w]O2ntk"
[final.jpg] first uses a Caesar Cipher: 4 shift = imgur.com/m9sYK.jpg (Decoy Photo/Clue)
[final.jpg] first uses OutGuess: Book code + reddit.com/r/a2e7j6ic78h0j 
3301 first uses an anagram for the reddit username CageThrottleUs = CharoletteGuest
3301 (as u/CageThrottleUs) posts "Welcome" [KXLOP.jpg] giving = PGP Key ID 7A35090F via OutGuess 


2012-01-07	January 7th	

3301 uses an anagram again for the reddit username ImagoOnNib = Mabinogion 
3301 (as u/ImagoOnNib/Mabinogion grows impatient "Problems?" 
3301 first uses a Vigenère cipher, hiding the key in the reddit header (Maya Numerals) and description (Substution cipher) 
3301 [final.jpg] first uses a Book Code: Mabinogion + Book code = Call us at us tele phone numBer two one four three nine oh nine six oh eight
[final.jpg] first uses a landline phone number: (+1)2143909608 = 3301 x 506 x 503 [final.jpg] dimensions = 845145127.com
[final.jpg] first uses a domain: 845145127.com = [cicada.jpg] 
[cicada.jpg] uses OutGuess again to say: 

	KYLE'S NOTES:
	Seeing as it's been three days since the first post, 
	and all these steps are linked, 
	I assume 3301 is just sitting by the telephone waiting for someone to figure it out. 
	This would explain the push to make their Mabinogion username, and the OutGuess saying "Key" for "Problems?".
	This shows the reddit header, decription as the Vigenère cipher and posts as the books for the book code, 
	was much harder and complicated than the simple phone call "3301 is one number, find the other two from the final.jpg" 
	Not 3 days, but the same day solvers were able to figure it out, land on the website, OutGuess the Cicada.jpg and 
	would end up making 3301 have to hurry up! (or was this planned all along?)
	This shows that 3301 isn't great with pacing and incrementaion of risk and reward. 
	This shows that 3301 want the solver to finish, giving multiple clues. 
	I don't know who the "We" is that is looking for highly intelligent individuals. 
	I don't beleive there is a prize, "a test" means you are being graded. 
	"the road to finding us." again hints at multiple people. 
	"We look forward to meeting the few that will make it all the way through." is very welcoming. 
	"Good luck. 3301" is very challenging, motivational, mysterious, and hinting at a prime truth (1 and self). 
	

2012-01-09	January 9th 

845145127.com updates to real-world co-ordinates (unverified photos, as they have OutGuess with PGP on them?)
[cicada.jpg] 


2012-01-11	January 11th 

845145127.com first uses binary, updating the page to only to tabs and spaces:

845145127.com changes to 127.0.0.1 and the previous IP (75.119.203.244) stopped responding to pings and TCP SYNs.






2013		January 	"Hello again. Our serach for intelligent individuals now continues."

366 days since the 2012 Cicada puzzle began. Nothing had happened in 11 months.

Until the 5th of January 2013, when a second image was posted to /x/ and /b/ imageboards on 4chan. 
There were three threads where 3301 posted 232.jpg on 4chan, two times on /b/ 23 hours apart(1,2) and once on /x/.


Key points about the track is the initial "breath" sound, believed to be the sound of many cicadas and the tempo changes, beginning at approximately 135 bpm, accelerating to 145bpm, then slowing to 125bpm. This has led some to believe that the song has been slowed down by 5%. The only instruments used were a guitar acoustic and electric and an effect driven bass drum.
The song is 2:47 long, or 167 seconds, which is prime. It is also a reversal of the name of the file: 761.mp3, and 761 is also prime.
A draft spectral anlysis (http://www.anony.ws/i/2013/01/07/SE5OU.png) shows a constant hum at 15.4-16.1kHz, and empty notches under 500Hz starting from 1:56. A hexdump of the mp3 file revealed the following message:

			KYLE'S NOTE: 
			Try extending the song to 761 seconds! (3301 loves reversing and flipping numbers)

		- -----END COMPRESSED RSA ENCRYPTED MESSAGE-----


			N used to encrypt this message is far smaller than 2048 or 4096 bits, only being 432 bits (130 decimal digits) long.
			A small group of people decided that a distributed approach would be the only feasible option. 
			Even a 432 bit key requires an enormous computational effort not suited for a single processor. 
			We agreed on [cado-nfs], a program to obtain the prime factors of large integers using a network of machines. 					After about 8 hours of debugging, fixing, patching and testing, 
			as well as additional 9 hours of distributively working on the prime, the results were in:		

				p = 97513779050322159297664671238670850085661086043266591739338007321
				q = 77506098606928780021829964781695212837195959082370473820509360759

				Result:		Scheme: Crypt::RSA::ES::OAEP
			
					The programming language Perl uses double colons to achieve modularization. 
					Therefore, we can safely conclude that a Perl program was used to encrypt this message. 
					A decryption program in Perl using the found p and q values is available here.

		An hour after the 512 characters long string finished growing, at 05:31:40 GMT the document changed. 
		The old 512-character code was gone, along with the HTML comment. In its place was the following document:

			<!--761-->
			(https://web.archive.org/web/20140111205628/https://infotomb.com/oyfhl.txt)

				The new string is 3641299(?) characters long. 
				It contains a significant amount of repeated text.

					Convert the string into its binary representation
					Flip all the bits (i.e. 0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0) [Note: this is equivalent to XOR 111111]
					Looking at that XOR'd binary string, notice the first two bytes are 0xFF 0xD8, a JPEG image.
					Later in the string, discover the same byte sequence again, the presence of more than one JPEG. 
					Analyse the rest of the stringn, discover a total of three JPEG images. 
					The third JPEG image is in reverse order, and needs to be un-reversed.
					Clarification, the order was this: .... = JPEG data, [ ] = one complete image:
					[0xFF 0xD8....][0xFF 0xD8....][....0xD8 0xFF]
					After transforming the bytes into their proper JPEG format:
						
						dd if=onioninvert.bin of=onion1.jpg bs=1 skip=0 count=168876
						dd if=onioninvert.bin of=onion2.jpg bs=1 skip=168876 count=1476614
						dd if=onioninvert.bin of=onion3rev.jpg bs=1 skip=1645490 count=175159
						
						Obtained the following three images:

						onion1.jpg "Liber Primus" aka 00.jpg	OutGuess: https://pastebin.com/q5zsjs0m
						onion2.jpg "Intus" aka 01.jpg		OutGuess: https://pastebin.com/1rg5k5wS	
						onion3rev.jpg "Runes" aka 02.jpg	OutGuess: https://pastebin.com/bUDQkQxq	
	
						XOR on each outguess contained:

							After trial and error analysis, 
							this ciphertext was created using a simple column transposition cipher. 
							(https://tholman.com/other/transposition/)
							Enter: IDGTKUMLOOARWOERTHISUTETLHUTIATSLLOUIMNITELNJ7TFYVOIUAUSNOCO5JI4MEODZZ 
							Key Length: 14 
							Then it will arrange the ciphertext into 14 columns like so:

							0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
							I D G T K U M L O O A  R  W  O
							E R T H I S U T E T L  H  U  T
							I A T S L L O U I M N  I  T  E
							L N J 7 T F Y V O I U  A  U  S
							N O C O 5 J I 4 M E O  D  Z  Z
 
							And reordering the columns like so:

							2 8 9 1	12 13 11 4 5 7 3 0 6 10
							G O O D	W  O  R  K U L T I M A
							T E T R	U  T  H	 I S T H E U L

							A message is obtained:

							GOOD WORK
							ULTIMATE TRUTH IS THE ULTIMATE ILLUSION 
							JOIN US AT FV7LYUCMEOZZD5J4ONIO

							Assuming the final N was omitted to fit the bounds of the column transposition cipher, 
							Apply formatting and the Tor address is obtained: fv7lyucmeozzd5j4.onion
											  		    "The Third Onion"

"The Third Onion"
fv7lyucmeozzd5j4.onion

A blank page. 
The page remained blank for a short time and then changed to the following document:

	<!--1033-->
	87de5b7fa2

		As with the RSA onion, the string slowly grew over time. 
		Two new characters (1 byte, 4 bits) added at varying intervals. Some timing data was collected for further analysis.

In the meantime, a solver ran the tool DirBuster against the site and discovered a misconfiguration of the backend Apache server. 
The server was leaking a system status page. 
Whether this was intentional is unknown. 
After the page was discovered, it appears 3301 was alerted because the content changed. 

	Appended to the end of the server status was yet another very long string. 
	This string was found to contain two image files in a similar ordering as the RSA onion, 
	except that there was some data between them (OOB or Out Of Bounds data):

	[0xFF 0xD8..............................] [Data in between JPGs] [..............................0xD8 0xFF]

		After building the first JPG from the hex:

		xxd -p -r < server-status.hex > server-status.jpg

		One obtains the image [onion_3_v3.jpg] aka [05.jpg] with runes, the Cicada image, and a magic prime number box.
		Doing the same for the reversed copy of the second JPG yields the same image as the first, shown -- except for that OOB data.

		Comparing the first and second images

			cmp -l server-status.jpg rev.server-status.jpg
		
				one obtains the OOB data:

				a02373230202020202833313020202020213433302020202021333130202020202135313a06363
				330202020202939313020202020203331302020202020323330202020202028313a06323230202
				020202534323020202020202139302020202025343230202020202632323a08313020202020203
				2333020202020203331302020202029393130202020202636333a0135313020202020213331302
				02020202134333020202020283331302020202022373230a0a

				Note that all of these bytes are within the printable range of ASCII characters, 
				and many of them appear to be ASCII for digits (e.g. 0x30, 0x39).

					Converting this string to binary: 	xxd -b oob.hex oob.bin
					and reversing that: 			xxd -r oob.bin oob-rev.bin
					we obtain:

					272     138     341     131     151

					366     199     130     320     18

					226     245     91      245     226

					18      320     130     199     366

					151     131     341     138     272

					Among other things, this is a magic square whose magic number is -- you guessed it -- 1033.

Applying the Gematria Primus from the 2013 puzzle to 'Patience is a virtue' and summing the result = 761.
