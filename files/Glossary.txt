SHA-0		(not prime)	1993
SHA-1 		(not prime)	1995	Bit Length: 160 bits			(not prime)	
					Hexadecimal Length: 40 characters	(not prime)	
	- Secure Hash Algortihm		(e.g., da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709) 
	- takes an input and produces a fixed-length output of 160 bits (20-byte) hash values 
	- hash values aka a message digest are typically a 40-character hexadecimal string. 
	- Each hexadecimal character = 4 bits. 160 bits divided by 4 bits/character = 40 characters, 
	a consistent length for any input data. 
	- broken in 2005 (https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/sha1_broken.html)
	- NIST deprecated use in 2011, and digital signatures in 2013, and declared phase out by 2030
	- dropped from firefox abnd google 2017 
	- Microsoft discontinued SHA-1 code signing support for Windows Update on August 3, 2020

SHA-2		(PRIME)		2001
SHA-3		(PRIME)		2015
SHA-512		(not prime)	
SHA3-512	(not prime)


BLAKE		... William Blake related			
	
	-  a cryptographic hash function based on Daniel J. Bernstein's ChaCha stream cipher, 
	but an altered copy of the input block = XORed with round constants, added before each ChaCha round.
	- Like SHA-2, there are two variants differing in the word size.
		- one that uses 32-bit words, used for computing hashes up to 256 bits long
		- one that uses 64-bit words, used for computing hashes up to 512 bits long
	- The core block transformation combines 16 words of input with 16 working variables, 
	but only 8 words (256 or 512 bits) are preserved between blocks.
	- It uses a table of 16 constant words (the leading 512 or 1024 bits of the fractional part of π), 	and a table of 10 16-element permutations.
	- The 64-bit version (which does not exist in ChaCha) is identical, 
	but the rotation amounts are 32, 25, 16 and 11, and the number of rounds is increased to 16.

BLAKE2		(PRIME)		2012
BLAKE2b		(PRIME)		
BLAKE3 		(PRIME)		2020
BLAKE-224	(not prime, but William Blake related)	32-bit words, produces digest size of 224 bits
BLAKE-256	(not prime, but William Blake related)	32-bit words, produces digest size of 256 bits
BLAKE-384	(not prime, but William Blake related)	64-bit words, produces digest size of 384 bits
BLAKE-512	(not prime, but William Blake related)	64-bit words, produces digest size of 512 bits





MD5		(PRIME)
MD6		(not prime)




Outguess
a steganography tool originally developed by Niels Provos, programmed in C.
designed to hide information in JPEG images while preserving statistical properties to evade detection. 
"available under a BSD software license. Completely free for any use including commercial. Developed in Germany."
	1999 July 5 	version 0.1 - Initial release (Unix-like)
	1999 Aug 6 	version 0.13b - beta version
	2001 Feb 	version 0.2 - stable (not backward compatible).
	2013: 		"OutGuess Rebirth" (OGR) fork released by Laurent Perch with a GUI for Windows.
	2013 June: 	Version 1.0.8 of the Rebirth fork released.
	2015 Sept: 	Official development of the original OutGuess was abandoned and the site was shut down.
	2018 - 2021: 	New repository (resurrecting-open-source-projects) released versions 0.2 to 0.4.
	2021 Sept 2: 	Latest stable release (0.4) in the new repository.

Poly1305	(not prime)				2002
	- takes a 16-byte secret key [r] and an [L]-byte message [m] and returns a 16-byte hash
Curve25519	(not prime)				
	- offers 128 bits of security (256-bit key size)
Salsa20		(not prime)				2008			
	- Key sizes are 128 or 256 bits, State size are 512 bits.
	- internal state is sixteen 32-bit words as a 4×4 matrix.
	- initial state is eight words of key (x), two words of stream position (y), 
	two words of nonce (essentially additional stream position bits) (x), and four fixed words (i).
	This is an example of a nothing-up-my-sleeve number. 
	The core operation in Salsa20 is the quarter-round QR(a, b, c, d) 
	that takes a four-word input and produces a four-word output.
